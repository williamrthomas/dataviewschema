If we treat as expected zero pay, would it just not show up on the ZP report? T Injections - We should potentially handle this like above. There are some Medicare scenarios where this may get paid, but mostly likely not. So we should define it as 'EXPECTED ZERO PAY', with no action if it got paid - it just would simply not show up on the ZP report X Statutory Exclusions - These are specific to LAB AND AMBULANCE SERVICES: We actually expect these to get paid however there are no RVU's and therefore a ZERO expected payment to compare it with.
