- Double-booked slots: A slot which occupies the same period of time as another slot is referred to as ""double booked"". These records appear multiple times in the data table, which when aggregated avoids double-counting these slots. Each double-booked appointment will have a unique Appointment ID, however.
- Point Values: These are arbitrary values given to appointment types and administered by the practice. This allows the practice to assign an arbitrary weighting to each appointment and analyze accordingly.

a. Layout and Notes
-  Ghosted Rows. Instead of void recreating, we create a ""ghost"" which is a voided image of what the charge used to look like. Then the post date of the original charge is moved up to the current month. These records aren't particularly important for the loading process if the above rules are used to process data files. What may be important though is not to assume that an ""old"" charge will have a ""Transaction ID"" value lower than a ""new"" charge. Ghosted rows also play an important role in reconciliation.

b. System Close
Athena's transaction system can only be reconciled against once the month end close process has completed, as only transactions from before the close date will be ghosted. 

c. FAQs
-  Transfers. Transfer Ins and Transfer Outs are simply moves from one responsible party to the next. They exist because the system was designed such that a closed charge will always balance to zero.
-  Amounts. Non-voided charges and ""transfer ins"" will have positive amounts, and non-voided payments, adjustments and ""transfer outs"" will be negative. Negative amounts debit accounts receivable and positive amounts credit A/R.
-  Foreign Keys in Multiple Tablespaces. If your practice is spread across multiple tablespaces, the foreign keys won't be straight forward to join, as ID's for departments or providers will no longer be globally unique. They will be unique per tablespace, though, and can be found by joining both on the ID and on the CONTEXTID.

-  Overpayments. A charge will be overpaid when the payments and adjustments on the charge are greater than the charge itself. This can happen for any number of reasons and the claim will remain open until the charge is balanced.
-  Refunds. Refunds are payments with ""REFUND"" as the reason. Refunds will only be initiated by the practice.
-  Takebacks. Takebacks are a type of refund, performed by the insurance company when they discover an error and send a negative payment, or takeback, on an EOB. These will usually appear as non-voided payments with positive amounts in the transaction table that are not identified with a REFUND reason.
-  Recovery. Recoveries occur after a charge has been sent off to collections and money is then received. When a payment is posted, a portion of the COLLECT charge in the amount of the payment needs to be undone. This is accomplished with an adjustment with a reason of RECOVERY.
-  Current Payer. A claim will be setup with one or many insurances followed by the default self-pay insurance. Charges on that claim start off their responsibility with the primary payer and are indicated by the transfer type of '1'. Once primary responsibility has been fully resolved with the creation of subsequent PAYMENT, ADJUSTMENT or TRANSFEROUT transactions that equal the CHARGE amount, the responsibility is closed out. The transferred amount falls to the secondary insurance, transfer type '2', and then to the patient, transfer type 'p', as TRANSFERIN charges. The outstanding balances to a payer on a claim can be calculated by looking at all the transactions by transfer type for that claim. When the transactions sum to zero, as charges are positive amounts and payments, adjustments and transfers are negative, the associated claim status will most likely be 'CLOSED'.",Collector,19.7,Complex

a. Layout and Notes
The table for quality data. The quality data in this table aligns with what can be found in the Quality Management Report (QMR).
- P4P Program is the name of the quality program which tracks specific quality measures.
- P4P Measure is the name of the quality measure (i.e. Breast Cancer Screening, Tobacco Use Inquiry, etc.)
- Result Status is the patient's satisfaction information (SATISFIED, NOTSATISFIED, or EXCLUDED) for each measure
- Satisfied Date is populated when the Result Status is SATISFIED, and represents the date of the satisfaction criteria for the P4P Measure.

Q: Why don't I see satisfaction information for a given quality program?
A: The qmresult table includes a specific list of quality programs into which a provider must be enrolled in order to track quality data.
- The qmresult table includes only the programs specified in the list above. 
- To pull into the qmresult table, a provider must be enrolled into the program in athenaClinicals. To verify providers’ enrollments, please use the Quality Program and Clinical Guideline Enrollment Report in Report Library.

Q: What happens to a provider's data if they leave the practice or are unenrolled from a quality program? 
A: When providers leave a practice, Create Encounters is typically turned off. When this happens, a provider is automatically unenrolled from a quality program. Additionally, a provider can still be at the practice but may be unenrolled from a quality program. When a provider is unenrolled from a quality program, they are no longer tracking a quality programs' data, so they will no longer appear in this table.

Q: What if a provider just recently enrolled into a quality program?
A: When providers are enrolled into quality programs, a large amount of patient data must run through the Quality Management Engine to determine performance on quality measures. Due to the volume of information, this process takes approximately 3-5 days. You can expect that provider data will appear in the qmresult table after that time.
